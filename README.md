# MoneyTrackAndroid

## About:
This project is meant to be the native Android client of my currently live project live at [money.ddlele.com](https://money.ddlele.com). All the Source-code is and will be public and present in this **GitHub** repository. The app will be using the same API as the main client.

The main **purpose** of this project is learning new technologies and making the process of **tracking** and **saving money** a more pleasant **experience**.

Personal finance is a topic that touches every member of our society. At the same time, few schools have courses in how to manage your money. To make the most of your income , it's important to become financially literate, but as mentioned earlier, you have to do it by yourself as according to Denmark Statistics , liabilities of single persons under the age of 30 have been constantly growing over the last 5 years (Wealth and debt, 2021) ,which shows that there's room for improvement in the field of personal finance education.

In order to address peopleâ€™s need of having the right tool to help with personal finance, the idea of developing a solution that would help individuals track their incomes and expenses as well as do the budgeting is proposed.
